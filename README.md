Iterative-Deepening Conflict Based Search

Abstract
For Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) problems in the real world, in robotics and maps, Conflict Based Search (CBS) is the leading algorithm to find solutions. However, CBS faces time and memory limiting problems when faced with larger problem instances. This can be improved by implementing an Iterative-Deepening version of Conflict Based Search (IDCBS). This will theoretically allow the algorithm to improve time-wise and memory-wise. We will test these algorithms through multiple test cases, and compare results throughout the testing.
